Citizens portal have been launched today, it is in an early stage of development and is pretty barebones at the moment. However, we are constantly working on improving and expanding the features available on the platform. In the future, we hope to add more features and functionality to the portal to make it even more useful for citizens. For now, citizens can use the portal to access news and updates about their community, as well as create their own digital IDs, which can be used to access a variety of online services. We encourage all citizens to check out the portal and see what it has to offer, and we hope to see you all using it frequently in the future.
